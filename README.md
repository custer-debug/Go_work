# ServerGolang
This repository includes a backend and a frontend server. 
    
I use golang as my programming language. For the frontend, I used bootstrap. 
It is not in this repository, but you can download it from the link [bootstrap](https://bootstrap-4.ru/)
Also, to test this API, you need to install some packages. 
Before installing [fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/master/.github/README_ru.md) , I advise you to read the documentation. 

    go get -u github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2

This is the link to work with the database, and the link to install 
[MySql for Golang](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql):

    go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
