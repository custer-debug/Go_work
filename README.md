# ServerGolang
    This repository includes a backend and a frontend server. 
    
I use golang as my programming language. For the frontend, I used bootstrap. 
It is not in this repository, but you can download it from the link [bootstrap](https://bootstrap-4.ru/)
Also, to test this API, you need to install some packages. Here are the links 
[fiber](https://github.com/gofiber/fiber/blob/master/.github/README_ru.md) and
[MySql for Golang](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql).
